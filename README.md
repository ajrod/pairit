Angel Hack project - This is a hackathon project myself, Warren Marivel and Suryva Nallu participated in; three
University of Toronto Undergraduates. This Toronto hackathon is one of the largest in the World with 100s of teams 
this year. You can find more information about angel hack here at their [website](http://angelhack.ca).

The theme of the hackathon was to solve any problem in about 24 hours. We chose to create a Pair Programming app,
to allow remote users to easily collaborate with no downloads or any plugins. We called this prototype PairIT.


At the end of the 24 hour sprint, we had a basic IDE that could be shared with other users in real time.
Think of it as google docs for programmers; as you edit the file other users in the session see 
these changes in real time. We made it so that there could only be one person editing the code at a time (the driver)
and one or more navigators. The driver and navigator could easily switch at any time.

To make collaboration efficent we added syntax highlighting for several languages (such as Python), 
syntax checking, a chat window you, and you could upload a file by dragging and droping new files into the editor. 
Finally, once your done editing the file you could export the file, to a gist or download it.



Warning
-----
None of us had any experience in Node but we thought it would be exciting to learn something new as we go.
Combine this with the extreme time constraints and pressure of a hackathon, to create your product in 24 hrs and 
you have a recipe for dirty code! So I warn you, some of the code is inefficient and just plain ugly; 
many sacrifices needed to be made for immediate gains and anyone who wants to look at the code will probably find it 
painful to read.
