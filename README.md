(rough draft readme)
Angel Hack project - This is a hackathon project myself, Warren Marivel and Suryva Nallu participated in; three
University of Toronto Undergraduates.

The theme of the hackathon was to solve any problem in about 24 hours. We chose to create a Pair Programming app,
to allow remote users to easily collaborate with no downloads or any plugins. We called this prototype PairIT.

At the end of the 24 hour sprint, we had a basic IDE that could be shared with other users in real time.
Think of it as google docs for programmers; as you edit the file other users in the session see 
these changes in real time. We made it so that there could only be one person editing the code at a time (the driver)
and one or more navigators. The driver and navigator could easily switch at any time.

To make collaboration efficent we added syntax highlighting for several languages (such as Python), 
syntax checking, a chat window you could drag and drop new files into the editor. 
Finally, Once your done editing the file export the file, to a gist or download it.
